# Patently True User Guide

# DESCRIPTION 
	
This package contains all of the steps necessary to run the Patently True project. 
This will take you through the steps we took to run Newmans Ground Truth Algorithm (NGTA)
on public Patent Data. It involves 4 main steps:

1. Download the raw patent data from patentsview.org.
2. Execute the sql scripts to wrangle the data into graph form (nodes and edges tables)
3. Execute NGTA on the node data.
4. Display a front end local web server to display the results of the NGTA algorithm on the graph.

# INSTALLATION 

## 1. Download raw data

# EXECUTION

For the purposes of this demo, we will be using a subset of our results from running the NGTA
algorihtm on the patent data. 

In order to start the visualization....TODO
